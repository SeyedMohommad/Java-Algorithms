## Introduction

This repository contains a wide range of algorithms implemented in Java, organized by category. Each algorithm is implemented in a simple and clear manner to facilitate understanding and learning. Whether you are a student, educator, or developer, you will find this collection helpful for studying and implementing algorithms.

## Categories


The algorithms are categorized as follows:

- [Searching Algorithms](./src/SearchingAlgorithms/)
- [Sorting Algorithms](./src/SortingAlgorithms/)
- [Greedy Algorithms](./src/GreedyAlgorithms/)
- [Dynamic Programming](./src/DynamicProgramming/)
- [Graph Algorithms](./src/GraphAlgorithms/)
- [Pattern Searching](./src/PatternSearching/)
- [Recursion](./src/Recursion/)
- [Backtracking](./src/Backtracking/)
- [Divide and Conquer](./src/DivideAndConquer/)


## Installation

To use the algorithms, simply clone this repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/SeyedMohommad/Java-Algorithms.git
```

Navigate to the directory:
``` 
cd Java-Algorithms
```

## Usage
Each algorithm is contained within its own file under the appropriate category. To run an algorithm, navigate to its directory and compile the Java file using javac, then run it using java. For example, to run Bubble Sort:
``` 
cd src/SortingAlgorithms
javac BubbleSort.java
java BubbleSort
```
