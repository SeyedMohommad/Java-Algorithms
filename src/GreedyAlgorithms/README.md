# Greedy Algorithms

This directory contains implementations of various greedy algorithms in Java. Each algorithm has its own subdirectory with the Java implementation and a dedicated `README.md` file explaining the algorithm, its usage, and examples.

## Algorithms Included

- [Dijkstra’s Algorithm](./DijkstrasAlgorithm/README.md): Finds the shortest paths from a source vertex to all vertices in a graph.
- [Kruskal’s Algorithm](./KruskalsAlgorithm/README.md): Finds the minimum spanning tree of a connected, undirected graph.
- [Fractional Knapsack Problem](./FractionalKnapsack/README.md): Maximizes the value that can be carried in a knapsack with a given capacity.
- [Scheduling and Resource Allocation](./SchedulingAndResourceAllocation/README.md): Maximizes profit or efficiency when allocating limited resources.
- [Coin Change Problem](./CoinChangeProblem/README.md): Finds the minimum number of coins required to make a given amount.
- [Huffman Coding](./HuffmanCoding/README.md): Assigns variable-length codes to input characters for data compression.

## Usage

Each algorithm can be run individually. Navigate to the specific algorithm's directory and compile the Java file using `javac`, then run it using `java`. For example, to run Dijkstra’s Algorithm:

```bash
cd DijkstrasAlgorithm
javac DijkstrasAlgorithm.java
java GreedyAlgorithms.DijkstrasAlgorithm.DijkstrasAlgorithm
```
