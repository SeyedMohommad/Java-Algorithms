# Searching Algorithms

This directory contains implementations of various searching algorithms in Java.

## Algorithms

- **Linear Search**: A simple search algorithm that checks every element in the list until the target value is found or the list ends.
- **Binary Search**: A more efficient search algorithm that works on sorted lists by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.

## Usage

### Linear Search

To run the Linear Search algorithm, compile and run the `LinearSearch.java` file:

```bash
javac SearchingAlgorithms/LinearSearch.java
java SearchingAlgorithms.LinearSearch
