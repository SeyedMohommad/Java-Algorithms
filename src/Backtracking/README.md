# Backtracking Algorithms

This directory contains implementations of various backtracking algorithms in Java. Backtracking is an algorithmic technique for solving problems incrementally, by trying partial solutions and then abandoning them if they are not suitable.

## Algorithms Included

- [N-Queens Problem](./NQueens/README.md): Places `n` queens on an `n x n` chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other.
- [Sudoku Solver](./SudokuSolver/README.md): Solves a given Sudoku puzzle using backtracking.
- [Rat in a Maze](./RatInAMaze/README.md): Finds a path for a rat to reach the destination in a maze.
- [Hamiltonian Cycle](./HamiltonianCycle/README.md): Finds a Hamiltonian Cycle in a given graph.

## Usage

Each algorithm can be run individually. Navigate to the specific algorithm's directory and compile the Java file using `javac`, then run it using `java`. For example, to run the N-Queens algorithm:

```bash
cd NQueens
javac NQueens.java
java Backtracking.NQueens.NQueens
```
## Applications

Backtracking is used in a wide range of applications, including:

- Puzzle Solving: Solving puzzles like Sudoku and N-Queens.
- Graph Theory: Finding cycles and paths in graphs.
- Constraint Satisfaction Problems: Used in AI to solve problems with constraints.
