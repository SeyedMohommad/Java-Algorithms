# KMP (Knuth-Morris-Pratt) Algorithm

The **KMP Algorithm** is an efficient pattern searching algorithm that avoids unnecessary comparisons by using information from previous matches.

## Algorithm

1. Preprocess the pattern to create an array of longest proper prefix that is also a suffix (LPS).
2. Use the LPS array to skip unnecessary comparisons in the text.

## Example

Given a text `ABABDABACDABABCABAB` and a pattern `ABABCABAB`, the algorithm will find a match at index `10`.

## Usage

To run the KMP Algorithm, compile and run the `KMPAlgorithm.java` file:

```bash
javac PatternSearching/KMPAlgorithm/KMPAlgorithm.java
java PatternSearching.KMPAlgorithm.KMPAlgorithm
```

## Applications

- Text Editors: Efficient search and replace operations.
- Bioinformatics: Finding motifs in DNA sequences.
