# Boyer-Moore Algorithm

The **Boyer-Moore Algorithm** is an efficient string-searching algorithm that skips sections of the text to quickly find a pattern.

## Algorithm

1. Preprocess the pattern to create a bad character heuristic.
2. Slide the pattern over the text from left to right.
3. If a mismatch occurs, use the bad character heuristic to skip sections of the text.

## Example

Given a text `ABAAABCD` and a pattern `ABC`, the algorithm will find a match at index `4`.

## Usage

To run the Boyer-Moore Algorithm, compile and run the `BoyerMooreAlgorithm.java` file:

```bash
javac PatternSearching/BoyerMooreAlgorithm/BoyerMooreAlgorithm.java
java PatternSearching.BoyerMooreAlgorithm.BoyerMooreAlgorithm
```

## Applications

- Text Editors: Fast search and replace operations.
- Genome Analysis: Finding patterns in DNA sequences.
