# Pattern Searching Algorithms

This directory contains implementations of various pattern searching algorithms in Java. Each algorithm is implemented to demonstrate different strategies for finding a pattern within a text. These algorithms have their own subdirectories with Java implementations and detailed documentation.

## Algorithms Included

- [Naive Pattern Search](./NaivePatternSearch/README.md): A simple approach that checks for the presence of a pattern in a text by sliding the pattern one character at a time.
- [KMP (Knuth-Morris-Pratt) Algorithm](./KMPAlgorithm/README.md): An efficient algorithm that preprocesses the pattern to skip unnecessary comparisons.
- [Rabin-Karp Algorithm](./RabinKarpAlgorithm/README.md): A hashing-based algorithm that quickly checks for pattern matches.
- [Boyer-Moore Algorithm](./BoyerMooreAlgorithm/README.md): An advanced algorithm that skips sections of the text to speed up the search.

## Usage

Each algorithm can be run individually. Navigate to the specific algorithm's directory and compile the Java file using `javac`, then run it using `java`. For example, to run the KMP Algorithm:

```bash
cd KMPAlgorithm
javac KMPAlgorithm.java
java PatternSearching.KMPAlgorithm.KMPAlgorithm
```

## Applications

Pattern searching algorithms are widely used in:

- Text Processing: Search and replace operations in text editors.
- Bioinformatics: DNA sequence analysis.
- Data Mining: Finding patterns in large datasets.
