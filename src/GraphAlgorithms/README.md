# Graph Algorithms

This directory contains implementations of various graph algorithms in Java. Each algorithm is implemented using an adjacency matrix representation of a graph. The algorithms have their own subdirectories, with Java implementations and detailed documentation explaining the algorithms, their usage, and examples.

## Overview

Graphs are fundamental structures in computer science, used to represent relationships between pairs of objects. They are widely used in various applications such as network analysis, pathfinding, scheduling, and more. This collection of graph algorithms is intended to help understand and implement common graph operations and traversal techniques.

## Algorithms Included

- **Graph Representation**
    - [Adjacency Matrix](./AdjacencyMatrix/README.md): Basic graph representation using an adjacency matrix.

- **Graph Traversal Algorithms**
    - [Breadth-First Search (BFS)](./BFS/README.md): Traverses the graph level by level, starting from a given source vertex.
    - [Depth-First Search (DFS)](./DFS/README.md): Traverses the graph by exploring each branch fully before backtracking.

## Usage

Each algorithm can be run individually. Navigate to the specific algorithm's directory and compile the Java file using `javac`, then run it using `java`. For example, to run BFS:

```bash
cd BFS
javac BFS.java
java GraphAlgorithms.BFS.BFS
```
## Applications

Graph algorithms are essential in solving many real-world problems, including:

- **Network Analysis**: Finding shortest paths, detecting cycles, and analyzing connectivity in networks.
- **Pathfinding**: Used in routing algorithms, GPS systems, and games.
- **Scheduling**: Topological sorting in task scheduling and dependency management.
- **Search Engines**: Crawling and indexing web pages.
