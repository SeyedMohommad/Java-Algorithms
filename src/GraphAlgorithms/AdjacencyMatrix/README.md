# Graph Representation using Adjacency Matrix

This directory contains an implementation of a graph using an adjacency matrix in Java. An adjacency matrix is a 2D array that represents the connections (edges) between vertices in a graph.

## Key Features

- **addEdge(int source, int destination)**: Adds an edge between the source and destination vertices.
- **removeEdge(int source, int destination)**: Removes the edge between the source and destination vertices.
- **display()**: Displays the adjacency matrix representing the graph.
- **hasEdge(int source, int destination)**: Checks if there is an edge between the source and destination vertices.

## Example

Hereâ€™s an example of how to use this class:

```java
Graph graph = new Graph(5);

// Add edges
graph.addEdge(0, 1);
graph.addEdge(0, 4);
graph.addEdge(1, 2);
graph.addEdge(1, 3);
graph.addEdge(1, 4);
graph.addEdge(2, 3);
graph.addEdge(3, 4);

// Display the adjacency matrix
System.out.println("Adjacency Matrix:");
graph.display();

// Check for an edge
System.out.println("Does an edge exist between vertex 0 and 1? " + graph.hasEdge(0, 1));
System.out.println("Does an edge exist between vertex 1 and 4? " + graph.hasEdge(1, 4));
```
 ## Usage
To run the graph implementation using an adjacency matrix, compile and run the Graph.java file:

```bash
javac GraphAlgorithms/AdjacencyMatrix/Graph.java
java GraphAlgorithms.AdjacencyMatrix.Graph
```
## Applications

Graphs are used in various applications such as network analysis, scheduling, and navigation. This implementation provides a simple way to understand how graphs can be represented and manipulated in Java.
