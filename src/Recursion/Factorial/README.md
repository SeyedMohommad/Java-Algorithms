# Factorial

The **Factorial** of a non-negative integer `n` is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to `n`. It is denoted by `n!`.

## Algorithm

- **Base Case**: If `n` is 0, return 1.
- **Recursive Case**: Return `n * factorial(n-1)`.

## Example

Given a number `5`, the factorial is calculated as `5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120`.

## Usage

To run the Factorial algorithm, compile and run the `Factorial.java` file:

```bash
javac Recursion/Factorial/Factorial.java
java Recursion.Factorial.Factorial
```
## Applications

- Combinatorics: Calculating permutations and combinations.
- Probability: Determining the likelihood of events.
