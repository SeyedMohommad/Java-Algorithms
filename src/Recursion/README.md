# Recursion Algorithms

This directory contains implementations of various recursion algorithms in Java. Recursion is a method where the solution to a problem depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem. Each algorithm is implemented with a focus on clarity and educational value.

## Algorithms Included

- [Factorial](./Factorial/): Calculates the factorial of a number using recursion.
- [Fibonacci](./Fibonacci/): Generates Fibonacci numbers using recursion.
- [Tower of Hanoi](./TowerOfHanoi/): Solves the classic Tower of Hanoi puzzle using recursion.
- [Permutations](./Permutations/): Generates all possible permutations of a given string.

## Usage

Each algorithm can be run individually. Navigate to the specific algorithm's directory and compile the Java file using `javac`, then run it using `java`. For example, to run the Fibonacci algorithm:

```bash
cd Fibonacci
javac Fibonacci.java
java Recursion.Fibonacci.Fibonacci
```
## Applications

Recursion is widely used in various fields:

- Algorithm Design: Recursive approaches are fundamental in algorithms like sorting, searching, and dynamic programming.
- Mathematics: Recursive definitions are common in mathematical concepts and proofs.
- Problem Solving: Recursive methods simplify the process of solving complex problems by breaking them down into simpler sub-problems.
