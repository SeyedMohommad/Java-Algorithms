# Bubble Sort

**Bubble Sort** is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm. It repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

## Algorithm

1. Start from the beginning of the list.
2. Compare adjacent elements and swap if necessary.
3. Continue this process until the list is sorted.

## Example

Given an array `{64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90}`, Bubble Sort will sort the array as `{11, 12, 22, 25, 34, 64, 90}`.

## Usage

To run the Bubble Sort algorithm, compile and run the `BubbleSort.java` file:

```bash
javac SortingAlgorithms/BubbleSort/BubbleSort.java
java SortingAlgorithms.src.BubbleSort.BubbleSort
```
