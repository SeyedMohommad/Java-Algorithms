# Quick Sort

**Quick Sort** is a highly efficient divide and conquer sorting algorithm that selects a pivot element and partitions the array into elements less than and greater than the pivot.

## Algorithm

1. **Divide**: Partition the array around a pivot element.
2. **Conquer**: Recursively sort the sub-arrays before and after the partition.
3. **Combine**: No explicit combining step is required, as the array is sorted in place.

## Example

Given an array `{10, 7, 8, 9, 1, 5}`, the algorithm will sort it into `{1, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10}`.

## Usage

To run the Quick Sort algorithm, compile and run the `QuickSort.java` file:

```bash
javac DivideAndConquer/QuickSort/QuickSort.java
java DivideAndConquer.QuickSort.QuickSort
```
## Applications

- Sorting: Quick Sort is one of the most widely used sorting algorithms due to its efficiency.
- Divide and Conquer: It is a prime example of the divide and conquer strategy.
