# Divide and Conquer Algorithms

This directory contains implementations of various Divide and Conquer algorithms in Java. Divide and Conquer is a powerful algorithmic technique that involves breaking a problem into smaller sub-problems, solving those sub-problems independently, and then combining their results to solve the original problem.

## Algorithms Included

- [Merge Sort](./MergeSort/README.md): A sorting algorithm that divides the array into two halves, sorts each half, and then merges the sorted halves.
- [Quick Sort](./QuickSort/README.md): A sorting algorithm that uses a pivot to partition the array and then recursively sorts the partitions.
- [Binary Search](./BinarySearch/README.md): A search algorithm that finds an element in a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half.
- [Closest Pair of Points](./ClosestPairOfPoints/README.md): A geometric algorithm that finds the closest pair of points in a set of points.

## Usage

Each algorithm can be run individually. Navigate to the specific algorithm's directory and compile the Java file using `javac`, then run it using `java`. For example, to run the Merge Sort algorithm:

```bash
cd MergeSort
javac MergeSort.java
java DivideAndConquer.MergeSort.MergeSort
```
## Applications

Divide and Conquer is widely used in various fields, including:

- Sorting and Searching: Efficient algorithms for sorting and searching.
- Computational Geometry: Solving geometric problems like finding the closest pair of points.
- Algorithm Design: Used in many other algorithms to improve efficiency by breaking down complex problems.
