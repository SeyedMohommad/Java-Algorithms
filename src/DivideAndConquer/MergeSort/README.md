# Merge Sort

**Merge Sort** is a classic divide and conquer algorithm that sorts an array by dividing it into two halves, sorting each half, and then merging the sorted halves.

## Algorithm

1. **Divide**: Divide the array into two halves.
2. **Conquer**: Recursively sort both halves.
3. **Combine**: Merge the two sorted halves into a single sorted array.

## Example

Given an array `{12, 11, 13, 5, 6, 7}`, the algorithm will sort it into `{5, 6, 7, 11, 12, 13}`.

## Usage

To run the Merge Sort algorithm, compile and run the `MergeSort.java` file:

```bash
javac DivideAndConquer/MergeSort/MergeSort.java
java DivideAndConquer.MergeSort.MergeSort
```

## Applications

- Sorting: Efficient sorting of large datasets.
- Divide and Conquer: Example of a divide and conquer algorithm used in various computer science problems.
